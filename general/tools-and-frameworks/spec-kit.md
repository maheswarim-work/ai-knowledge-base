## Overview

Open-source toolkit for Spec-Driven Development (SDD). Treats specifications as executable blueprints rather than guides—specifications define what to build before implementation begins.

## Core Concept

Inverts traditional development: AI coding agents generate implementations directly from comprehensive specifications instead of casual prompts.

## CLI Commands

### Core Workflow
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/speckit.constitution` | Define project governing principles |
| `/speckit.specify` | Document requirements and user stories |
| `/speckit.plan` | Create technical implementation strategies |
| `/speckit.tasks` | Generate actionable task lists |
| `/speckit.implement` | Execute all tasks systematically |

### Optional Enhancement
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/speckit.clarify` | Resolve underspecified requirements |
| `/speckit.analyze` | Verify artifact consistency |
| `/speckit.checklist` | Create quality validation checklists |

## Supported Agents

Works with 15+ AI coding agents including Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, and Qwen.
