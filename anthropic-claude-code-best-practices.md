## Overview

Comprehensive guide for effectively using Claude Code, covering customization, workflows, and optimization techniques.

## Key Topics

### Customization & Setup
- Create `CLAUDE.md` files for bash commands, code style, and project info
- Manage tool permissions
- Install GitHub CLI for integration

### Tool Enhancement
- Expand capabilities through bash tools
- Use MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- Create custom slash commands in `.claude/commands`

### Common Workflows
- Explore and plan before coding
- Test-driven development
- Visual iteration with screenshots
- "Safe YOLO mode" for autonomous work
- Codebase Q&A for onboarding

### Optimization Techniques
- Be specific with instructions
- Provide images and file references
- Use planning and context resets for course-correction
- Maintain checklists for complex tasks

### Headless Mode
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Issue triage automation
- Subjective code reviews

### Multi-Claude Workflows
- Parallel instances for code verification
- Multiple git checkouts/worktrees
- Programmatic integration via fanning out or pipelining
