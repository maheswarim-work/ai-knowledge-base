## Overview

Key patterns, tools, and platforms shaping AI-assisted software development in 2026, moving beyond simple prompt-based interactions toward sophisticated, orchestrated multi-agent systems.

## Key Topics

### Ralph Wiggum Pattern

An autonomous loop technique where AI agents repeatedly attempt tasks until success criteria are met. Useful for batch work and refactoring, but requires:
- Robust test definitions
- Proper guardrails to prevent runaway costs

### Agent Skills

Portable instruction packages that extend AI agent capabilities. Vercel's specification allows developers to install reusable expertise via CLI. Example: the `react-best-practices` skill packages over a decade of performance-optimization knowledge across 40+ rules.

### Orchestration Tools

Four primary platforms have emerged:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Conductor** | Runs multiple agents in parallel using isolated Git worktrees (macOS only) |
| **Vibe Kanban** | Cross-platform orchestrator with Kanban-style task management |
| **Claude Code Web** | Browser-based interface launched October 2025 |
| **GitHub Copilot Agent** | Issue-driven workflow with secure environments |

### Beads & Gas Town

Steve Yegge's solutions addressing agent coordination:
- **Beads**: Provides "durable reasoning trail" stored as versioned Git files
- **Gas Town**: Manages high-throughput agent factories using parallel worktrees

### Clawdbot

Local-first personal assistant running on your computer, accessible through existing messaging apps (iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp).

### Sub-agents

Specialized AI instances handling isolated tasks within workflows, improving context management and enabling parallelization.

## Key Takeaway

The field is evolving from single-agent interactions toward sophisticated, orchestrated multi-agent systems with persistent memory and specialized capabilities.
